## Getting started

Only GitHub Apps with proper permissions can publish checks, this [guide](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-branch-source-plugin/blob/master/docs/github-app.adoc) helps you authenticate your Jenkins instance as a GitHub App. 
The permission *read/write* on *Checks* needs to be granted in addition to the ones already mentioned in the guide.

## Features

### Build Status Check

![GitHub Status](docs/images/github-status.png)

This plugin implements [the status checks feature from Checks API Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/checks-api-plugin#build-status-check) to publish statuses (pending, in progress, and completed) to GitHub.

You can customize it by configuring the "Status Checks Properties" behavior for your GitHub SCM Source or Git SCM projects:

*Note: If you are using [GitHub Branch Source Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-branch-source-plugin), it will also send status notifications to GitHub through [Status API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#statuses).
You can disable it by using [Disable GitHub Multibranch Status Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/disable-github-multibranch-status-plugin) or [Skip Notification Trait Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/skip-notifications-trait-plugin).*

### Rerun Failed Build

![Failed Checks](docs/images/failed-checks.png)

A "Re-run" button will be added automatically by GitHub, by clicking it, you can schedule a new build for the **last** commit of this branch.

### Configuration
